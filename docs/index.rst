GTE Automation - Design & Architecture
======================================
Vandal is an orchestration engine deployed as SaaS and works directly with virtualization, provisioning, converged infrastructure and dynamic workflows . It aligns business requests with the applications, data, and infrastructure. It defines the policies and service levels through automated workflows, provisioning, and change management, creating an application-aligned infrastructure that can be scaled up or down based on the needs of each application. Provides centralized management of the resource pool, including scheduling, metering, and consumption.
